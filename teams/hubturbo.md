##### Contribution to MAJOR project HT

##### Contribution to MINOR project [opencv](https://github.com/Itseez/opencv)
- [Forked the repo](https://github.com/jinified/opencv)
- Read contribution guideline
- [Created sample application to understand more about the project](https://github.com/jinified/visionx/blob/master/scripts/vision_lib/draw.py)

##### Technology expertise in Computer Vision for Autonomous Systems
Short term plan 
- Analyzes main challenges for computer vision application in outdoor scenario i.e underwaater. 
- Read up on most cited computer vision journal papers to understand most fundamental algortihms in the field.
- Watch computer vision and machine learning related lecture videos to complement reading 
 - [University of Central Florida Computer Vision 2012, Mubarak Shah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=715uLCHt4jE&list=PLd3hlSJsX_Imk_BPmB_H3AQjFKZS9XgZm)

- Identify different areas of computer vision that I will work on and its sample applications

Long term plan 
- Integrate vision algorithm with [ROS(Robot Operating System)](http://www.ros.org/) which is commonly used in the industry and various robotics projects to create robotic software.
- Successfully completed a vision task specified in [Robosub rules](http://www.auvsifoundation.org/foundation/competitions/competition-central/robosub)
- Write a vision plugin for ROS

Progress
- [Created a GitHub repository for codes related to this project](https://github.com/jinified/visionx)
- [Complete research of potential focus areas of the project including relevant journal papers](https://github.com/jinified/visionx/blob/master/doc/Research.md)
- Complete basic ROS tutorials (needed to integrate vision algorithms)
